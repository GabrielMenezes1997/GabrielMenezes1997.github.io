- **Identified places with the most check-ins during the week:**

  Examined check-in data to determine peak locations for customer visits throughout the week. This information is crucial for resource allocation and optimizing operational efficiency in high-traffic areas.

- **Analyzed days with the least check-ins:**

  Found that Tuesdays experience the lowest check-in rates, suggesting a need for increased promotional efforts. Recommended strategic initiatives to boost customer engagement and drive traffic on slower days.

- **Analyzed customer behavior to identify patterns and improve recommendations:**

  Conducted a comprehensive analysis of user behavior to uncover trends and preferences. This enables more personalized and effective recommendations, enhancing overall customer satisfaction and business performance.

### Project - Subway Reviews Analysis

- **Description:** Conducted data analysis and created visualizations to evaluate statements from Subway Restaurant leadership:
- Head of Customer Service: “Our ratings are gradually improving, and we will soon reach 4.5/5.”
- Head of Store Operations: “Sandwiches are a tricky business. All sandwich chains suffer from poor customer ratings.”
- Head of Social Media: “The goal of 4.5/5 is unreasonable for national chains like us. Only small, local, and boutique restaurants can achieve such high ratings.”
- Chief Data Scientist: “It is well known that customers make the effort to give a rating only when they are either extremely angry or delighted with the service. So online ratings are not reliable.”
- **Technologies:** Python, CSV Files
Leveraging Python libraries like Matplotlib, Pandas, Numpy, and Seaborn, I analyzed customer review datasets in-depth, creating visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, and scatterplots to uncover meaningful insights. Through this analysis, I aligned with the Chief Data Scientist's hypothesis: customer reviews tend to be polarized, with most ratings clustering around 1-star (poor experiences) or 5-star (great experiences). This trend was consistent across reviews for other restaurants, highlighting a clear bias in online rating behavior. This trend looks consistent as you can see in the graph below:

Looking at this graph, customer ratings have declined over time, while the volume of reviews peaked around 2018 and significantly dropped after 2020, indicating a potential shift in customer satisfaction and engagement patterns.

Finally, I conducted a comparative analysis of the average ratings for Subway alongside its key competitors, including Jersey Mike's Subs and Panera Bread, to evaluate relative customer satisfaction and industry performance.

### Project - Data Visualization Analysis - Exploring Socioeconomic Trends in Brazil
- **Description:** Conducted an in-depth data analysis and visualization project focusing on socioeconomic factors and poverty trends in Brazil. The project aimed to uncover key insights about the population's living conditions based on characteristics such as age, gender, education, employment, and urban vs. rural living.

Key Analysis Areas:

Education and Poverty: Examined the relationship between education levels and poverty rates.
Urban vs. Rural Dynamics: Analyzed differences in socioeconomic factors between urban and rural populations.
Workforce Characteristics: Investigated employment patterns, including sectors of work and work permit prevalence.
Demographics and Income: Explored the impact of age, gender, and ethnicity on income distribution and poverty levels.
Leveraging Tableau Public, I designed interactive dashboards and visualizations, such as bar charts, line graphs, scatterplots, and storyboards, to present these findings. The project provided actionable insights for understanding Brazil’s socioeconomic disparities.
