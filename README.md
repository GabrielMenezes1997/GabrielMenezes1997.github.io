- **Identified places with the most check-ins during the week:**

  Examined check-in data to determine peak locations for customer visits throughout the week. This information is crucial for resource allocation and optimizing operational efficiency in high-traffic areas.

- **Analyzed days with the least check-ins:**

  Found that Tuesdays experience the lowest check-in rates, suggesting a need for increased promotional efforts. Recommended strategic initiatives to boost customer engagement and drive traffic on slower days.

### Project - Subway Reviews Analysis

- **Description:** Conducted data analysis and created visualizations to evaluate statements from Subway Restaurant leadership:
- Head of Customer Service: “Our ratings are gradually improving, and we will soon reach 4.5/5.”
- Head of Store Operations: “Sandwiches are a tricky business. All sandwich chains suffer from poor customer ratings.”
- Head of Social Media: “The goal of 4.5/5 is unreasonable for national chains like us. Only small, local, and boutique restaurants can achieve such high ratings.”
- Chief Data Scientist: “It is well known that customers make the effort to give a rating only when they are either extremely angry or delighted with the service. So online ratings are not reliable.”

Leveraging Python libraries like Matplotlib, Pandas, Numpy, and Seaborn, I analyzed customer review datasets in-depth, creating visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, and scatterplots to uncover meaningful insights. Through this analysis, I aligned with the Chief Data Scientist's hypothesis: customer reviews tend to be polarized, with most ratings clustering around 1-star (poor experiences) or 5-star (great experiences). This trend was consistent across reviews for other restaurants, highlighting a clear bias in online rating behavior. This trend looks consistent as you can see in the graph below:

Looking at this graph, customer ratings have declined over time, while the volume of reviews peaked around 2018 and significantly dropped after 2020, indicating a potential shift in customer satisfaction and engagement patterns.

Finally, I conducted a comparative analysis of the average ratings for Subway alongside its key competitors, including Jersey Mike's Subs and Panera Bread, to evaluate relative customer satisfaction and industry performance.
